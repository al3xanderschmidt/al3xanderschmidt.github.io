In my projects, I take on the role of lead developer and IT architect, as well as the arrangements between the department and the development team. Since 2016, I have been working exclusively in Scrum projects and was certified as a Scrummaster in 2018.

In the projects, I steadily expanded my knowledge in the areas of DevOps (Jenkins for CI / CD and automation, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform) and cloud computing with AWS. I support my customers with digitization, migration to the cloud and the automation of operating processes.
